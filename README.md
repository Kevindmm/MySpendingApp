# MySpendingApp

**MySpendingApp** is a lightweight personal finance tracker built with **Java 17** and **Spring Boot**.\
The goal is to create a clear and maintainable backend while showcasing modern Java 17 features in a practical way.

---

## MVP ¬∑ v0.1

- **Record transactions**  
  Add, edit, and delete expenses or income entries with date, amount, category, and optional note.

- **Transaction list with filters**  
  Chronological table with sorting, pagination, and quick filters by date range and category.

- **Monthly summary**  
  Totals for expenses, income, and balance‚Äîcompact overview of where the money goes.

- **Minimal categories + CRUD**  
  Seed set (Food, Transport, Leisure, etc.) with endpoints to add or rename categories.

- **Lightweight persistence**  
  SQLite for development, H2 for tests; schema auto-generated at backend startup.

- **REST API v1**  
  `/transactions` and `/categories` endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) returning clean JSON.

- **React frontend (SPA)**  
  Single page with ‚ÄúAdd transaction‚Äù form, transaction table, and summary section.

- **Smoke tests & CI**  
  Minimal seed data plus a couple of API smoke tests running in GitHub Actions.

## üöÄ Development Roadmap

| Phase | Purpose | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Phase 0 ‚Äì Setup | Skeleton, CI, Docker, health-check | ‚úÖ Done |
| Phase 1 ‚Äì Data Model | Finalise production-ready schema (users, categories, transactions, import batches) on SQLite/H2; seed demo data | ‚úçÔ∏è In progress |
| Phase 2 ‚Äì MVP (Spending CRUD) | Implement login + JWT and full spending CRUD on top of the mature DB | ‚¨ú Planned |
| Phase 3 ‚Äì Modernisation | Replace legacy constructs with Java 17+ features; introduce records, sealed classes | ‚¨ú Planned |
| Phase 4 ‚Äì Enhancements | FX API integration, dashboards, reporting, test-data tools | ‚¨ú Planned |



### ‚úÖ Phase 0 ‚Äî Setup (Completed!)
*Goal: bring the project to life locally with CI, health-check, logging, and a working Docker stack.*

- [x] **P0.1**  Spring Boot skeleton + Gradle build
- [x] **P0.2**  `/actuator/health` endpoint exposed and healthy
- [x] **P0.3**  GitHub Actions workflow (build + tests badge)
- [x] **P0.4**  Dockerised stack: backend (JDK 17 + SQLite) & frontend (React + Nginx) via `docker compose`
- [x] **P0.5**  Fix persistent logging: logs now land in `/app/logs`



### ‚úçÔ∏è Phase 1 ‚Äî Data Model (Working on it!)
*Goal: lock down a production-ready schema<‚Äî>users, categories, transactions and preload demo data so later phases can 
focus on business logic and UI.*

- [x] **P1.1**  Add README with schema diagram + [DB-evolution](docs/DB-evolution.md) log
- [x] **P1.2**  User entity & repository
- [x] **P1.3**  Category entity (per-user)
- [x] **P1.4** Setup dev/test environments, added H2 in-memory DB, test profile & Gradle/Docker test config
- [X] **P1.5** Extend Transaction with `user_id`, `category_id`, `note`
- [ ] **P1.6** Update Conversion model to UUID PKs
- [ ] **P1.7** Update schema.sql & data.sql for new entities/fields (User, Category, Transaction, Conversion changes)
- [ ] **P1.8** Seed demo user and default categories
- [ ] **P1.9** H2 integration tests for User & Transaction repos



### ‚¨ú Phase 2 ‚Äî MVP (Spending CRUD) !!Needs clarification!!
**Goal:** deliver core CRUD + summary endpoints using Java 17 records and Streams.

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Entity** | `Spending` (`id`, `amount`, `currency`, `category`, `type`, `date`) |
| **Endpoints** | `POST /api/v1/spendings` ¬∑ `GET /api/v1/spendings` ¬∑ `GET /api/v1/spendings/summary` |
| **Persistence** | SQLite (prod dev) / H2 (tests) |
| **Key Java 17** | Records (`SpendingRequest`, `SpendingResponse`) ¬∑ `Stream.toList()` ¬∑ `var` ¬∑ Jakarta Validation |



- [ ] Bootstrap project
- [ ] Spending entity
- [ ] Record DTOs
- [ ] Repository (`JpaRepository<Spending, Long>`)
- [ ] Service (`create`, `findAll`, `summary`)
- [ ] REST controller + MockMvc tests
- [ ] Validation on DTOs
- [ ] SQLite config (`ddl-auto=update`)
- [ ] Integration tests (happy path)
- P2.1 ‚Äì Quick filters & sorting (LocalDate + Streams)



### üïì Phase 3 ‚Äî Modernization (planned) !!Needs clarification!!

- Switch expressions & pattern matching in business logic
- Sealed hierarchy for `SpendingType` (`INCOME` / `EXPENSE`)
- Replace remaining POJOs with records where safe
- Modular package refactor & clearer domain boundaries



### üïì Phase 4 ‚Äî Enhancements (planned) !!Needs clarification!!

- Currency-rate integration & automatic conversion
- [ ] **P1.5**  ImportBatch entity & FK from Transaction
- CSV import / export, advanced reports, minimal dashboard
- Random test-data generators (`RandomGeneratorFactory`)
- Observability (metrics, tracing) and deployment hardening

## Language & Tools

- [JDK17](https://jdk.java.net/archive/)
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) - as a package manager
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) - as a server-side framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - client-side framework

---

## Quickstart

This section contains all the information required for getting the server up and running. The application contains the following two directories:

- [server/](server/) - the server directory that contains the server code
- [client/](client/) - the client directory that contains the client code

In order to run the application, you will need to have both the server and client running in separate terminals.

---

### Server

To run the server, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the server directory (in Unix that would be `cd server`)

2. Install the required dependencies by running `gradle build` or `gradlew build` if you're in Windows.

3. Start the server. `gradle bootRun` or `gradlew bootRun` - launches the Tomcat Server in debug mode on port 8080.

---

### Client

- System requirements
  - NodeJS v18

To run the client, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the client directory (in Unix that would be `cd client`)

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

You can ignore the severity vulnerabilities, this is a [known issue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/11174) related to `create-react-app` and are not real vulnerabilities.

3. Start the client

```bash
npm start
```

---

## Formatting Client

To format your code using [prettier](https://prettier.io/), follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the client directory (in Unix that would be `cd client`)

2. Run this command:

```bash
npm run lint
```

To ensure you are using the correct version of prettier, make sure to format your code after installing the dependencies (`npm install`).

---

## Database and Seed Data

**Note: No database setup should be required to get started with running the project.**

This project uses SQLite, which stores your tables inside a file (`server/database.db`) for development. You can inspect the seed data by looking into the (`server/src/main/resources`) folder in the main package.

The database is seeding from the `data.sql` file everytime the application is running. The data is seeded relative to today's date.

---

## Verify That Everything Is Set Up Correctly

To verify that the frontend is working properly, go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see the homepage that is titled "Welcome to My Spending App" and a chart as below.
